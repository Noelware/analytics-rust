# 🐻‍❄️🐾 Noelware Analytics for Rust
> *Rust client and server implementation of [Noelware Analytics](https://analytics.noelware.org)'s gRPC protocol*

**analytics-rs** is a Rust library that implements Noelware Analytics' protocol that can be interacted with Noelware Analytics. This brings in a client, server, and types implementation that is based off the [protocol buffers](https://github.com/Noelware/analytics-protobufs).

At the moment, **analytics-rs** only exports all the generated Rust client/server from **prost**/**tonic** use, we do plan to have a higher implementation than the low-level one at the moment.

**analytics-rs** is released under the **MIT License** with love by [Noelware](https://noelware.org)! 🐻‍❄️💜
